# 🤖 Autonomous Robotics Systems – Navigation, Manipulation & Perception (Webots)

This repository contains a collection of **autonomous robotics systems** developed in the **Webots simulator**, demonstrating core principles of **robot navigation, perception, manipulation, and behaviour coordination**.

The projects span **mobile robots** and **mobile manipulators**, integrating:
- Global and local navigation
- Vision and LiDAR-based perception
- PID control and kinematic modelling
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- Autonomous task execution in dynamic environments

---

## 🧠 Core Themes Across Projects

- **Hybrid robot architectures** (deliberative + reactive)
- **Sensor fusion** (Camera, LiDAR, GPS, Compass, Depth)
- **Autonomous decision making**
- **Safe and repeatable robot behaviour**
- **Explainable, modular design suitable for academic evaluation**
